# Multitracking
## Structure

This is my 1st project with multiple tracking objects. You can watch video how
I was testing this code here :

### How to use
- There're lots of detection algorithms, but in this project I used only
Boostin and CSRT, due to the best accuracy. Lines 36 - 40 - you could change it
- Also, I added labels to the objects, so now you can follow the order of the 
selected objects
